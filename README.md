My entry for the Ludum Dare #34 jam

This game was an attempt to quickly make something workable with [Gunship](https://github.com/excaliburHisSheath/gunship-rs), my experimental [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) game engine. While the experiment wasn't all that successful it was informative (several new issues were added to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/excaliburHisSheath/gunship-rs/issues)) and will certainly inform Gunship's development going forward.
